## User Workflows

### 1. Product Discovery Flow
```
User enters Shop Management →  
Views product grid → 
Uses search/filter to find specific products → 
Selects products of interest
```

### 2. Product Management Flow
```
User identifies product to manage → 
Clicks action button (View/Edit/Delete) → 
System performs requested action → 
User receives feedback → 
Grid updates accordingly
```

### 3. Bulk Operations Flow
```
User selects multiple products via checkboxes → 
Bulk selection panel appears → 
User chooses bulk action (Delete/Export) → 
System confirms action → 
Bulk operation executes → 
Grid updates with results
```

### 4. Product Creation Flow
```
User clicks "Add Product" → 
Product creation modal/form opens → 
User fills required information → 
System validates input → 
Product is created and added to grid
```

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- `selectedProducts`: Array of selected product IDs
- `showAddProduct`: Boolean for add product modal state
- `filterCategory`: Current category filter selection
- `searchQuery`: Current search term

### Action Handlers
- `handleProductAction(action, productId?)`: Central action dispatcher
  - Supports: add, view, edit, delete, bulk-delete, export
  - Logs actions for debugging
  - Provides extensible architecture for new actions

### Filtering Logic
- **Category Filtering**: Matches product category against selected filter
- **Search Filtering**: Searches across product name and category
- **Combined Filtering**: Both filters work together for refined results

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 1 column grid, stacked layout
- **Small**: 2 column grid, compact spacing
- **Large**: 3 column grid, standard spacing
- **Extra Large**: 4 column grid, maximum density

## Data Structure

### Product Object
```typescript
interface Product {
